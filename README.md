## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- B.E.M Methodology
- Namespaces CSS

### What I learned

This was a great start to understand, in a simple way, how to structure the classes to work like components, making it easier to modify and, more important, understand what is going on just reading the code.

### Continued development

Even this was a simple challenge, I find some little difficulties to name some classes, so that is something i will continue to study, specially in other's project, to get a pattern in what is the best names for each thing.
